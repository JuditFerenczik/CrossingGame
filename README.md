Turtle crossing game


Its a python game using the turtle module. Try to get to the other side of the screen without touching the obstacles arriving from the right.
If you touch them you are out and you have to start over.
With each crossing the speed will be increased and the game becomes harder. The goal is to go through as many time as possible.
The previous high score is presented on the top of the screen.
